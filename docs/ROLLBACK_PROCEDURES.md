## Quick Reference - Emergency Rollback

### Immediate Action (< 5 minutes)

```yaml
# EMERGENCY: Replace with composite action
- uses: ./.github/actions/sst-deploy  # Known working version
  with:
    stage: staging
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

# OR: Pin to previous working version
- uses: kodehort/sst-operations-action@v1.0.0  # Last known good
  with:
    operation: deploy
    stage: staging
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Critical Workflows to Update First
1. Production deployment workflows
2. Main branch CI/CD pipelines
3. Release automation workflows

---

## Rollback Scenarios and Procedures

### Scenario 1: Emergency Rollback (< 1 hour) 🚨

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Action causes workflow failures across multiple repositories
- Critical functional regressions discovered
- Security vulnerabilities identified
- Complete action unavailability

#### Immediate Response (0-5 minutes)

**Step 1: Stop New Deployments**
```bash
# Disable workflows using the action (if possible)
gh workflow disable "deploy.yml" --repo org/repo
gh workflow disable "pr-workflow.yml" --repo org/repo
```

**Step 2: Emergency Workflow Updates**
Update affected workflows immediately:

```yaml
# FROM: Current action
- uses: kodehort/sst-operations-action@v1
  with:
    operation: deploy
    stage: staging
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

# TO: Emergency rollback (Choose ONE)

# Option A: Composite action fallback
- uses: ./.github/actions/sst-deploy
  with:
    stage: staging
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

# Option B: Previous working version
- uses: kodehort/sst-operations-action@v1.0.0
  with:
    operation: deploy
    stage: staging 
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

#### Short-term Stabilization (5-60 minutes)

**Step 3: Systematic Rollback**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Emergency rollback script

AFFECTED_REPOS=(
    "org/project-1"
    "org/project-2" 
    "org/project-3"
)

for repo in "${AFFECTED_REPOS[@]}"; do
    echo "Rolling back $repo"
    
    # Method 1: Revert to composite actions
    gh api repos/$repo/contents/.github/workflows \
        | jq -r '.[].name' \
        | while read workflow; do
            echo "Updating $workflow in $repo"
            # Update workflow to use composite actions
        done
        
    # Method 2: Pin to previous version
    sed -i 's/kodehort\/sst-operations-action@v1/kodehort\/sst-operations-action@v1.0.0/g' \
        .github/workflows/*.yml
done
```

**Step 4: Validation**
```bash
# Test rollback in staging environments
for repo in "${AFFECTED_REPOS[@]}"; do
    gh workflow run "test-deploy.yml" --repo $repo
    echo "Waiting for $repo workflow to complete..."
    sleep 30
done
```

### Scenario 2: Gradual Rollback (< 24 hours) 🔄

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Performance degradation identified
- Non-critical functional issues
- Compatibility problems with specific workflows
- Partial feature failures

#### Phased Rollback Strategy

**Phase 1: Assessment (0-2 hours)**
```bash
# Analyze impact and categorize issues
echo "Assessing rollback scope..."

# Identify affected workflows
find . -name "*.yml" -path "./.github/workflows/*" \
    -exec grep -l "kodehort/sst-operations-action" {} \; > affected-workflows.txt

# Categorize by criticality
echo "Critical workflows:"
grep -E "(production|release|deploy)" affected-workflows.txt

echo "Non-critical workflows:"
grep -v -E "(production|release|deploy)" affected-workflows.txt
```

**Phase 2: Selective Rollback (2-8 hours)**
```bash
# Roll back critical workflows first
CRITICAL_WORKFLOWS=(
    ".github/workflows/production-deploy.yml"
    ".github/workflows/release.yml"
    ".github/workflows/main-branch-deploy.yml"
)

for workflow in "${CRITICAL_WORKFLOWS[@]}"; do
    echo "Rolling back critical workflow: $workflow"
    
    # Update to previous version
    sed -i 's/kodehort\/sst-operations-action@v1/kodehort\/sst-operations-action@v1.0.0/g' \
        "$workflow"
    
    # Test the rollback
    git add "$workflow"
    git commit -m "rollback: emergency rollback of $workflow to v1.0.0"
    git push
done
```

**Phase 3: Non-Critical Rollback (8-24 hours)**
```bash
# Roll back remaining workflows with testing
NON_CRITICAL_WORKFLOWS=(
    ".github/workflows/pr-preview.yml"
    ".github/workflows/test-deploy.yml"
    ".github/workflows/cleanup.yml"
)

for workflow in "${NON_CRITICAL_WORKFLOWS[@]}"; do
    echo "Rolling back non-critical workflow: $workflow"
    
    # Update and test in feature branch first
    git checkout -b "rollback-$(basename $workflow .yml)"
    
    sed -i 's/kodehort\/sst-operations-action@v1/kodehort\/sst-operations-action@v1.0.0/g' \
        "$workflow"
    
    git add "$workflow"
    git commit -m "rollback: gradual rollback of $workflow to v1.0.0"
    git push --set-upstream origin "rollback-$(basename $workflow .yml)"
    
    # Create PR for review
    gh pr create --title "Rollback: $(basename $workflow)" \
        --body "Gradual rollback of $workflow to previous version"
done
```

#### Validation and Monitoring

**Rollback Validation Checklist:**
```bash
# Automated validation script
#!/bin/bash

echo "🔍 Validating rollback..."

# Check workflow syntax
for workflow in .github/workflows/*.yml; do
    echo "Validating $workflow"
    yamllint "$workflow" || echo "❌ YAML issues in $workflow"
done

# Test critical workflows
gh workflow run "production-deploy.yml" --ref rollback-branch
gh workflow run "test-deploy.yml" --ref rollback-branch

# Monitor for success
sleep 300  # Wait 5 minutes
gh run list --limit 5 --json status,conclusion,workflowName

echo "✅ Rollback validation completed"
```

---

### Scenario 3: Long-term Recovery (> 24 hours) 🛠️

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Major architectural changes needed
- Multiple integration issues
- Complex compatibility problems requiring development

#### Recovery Planning Phase

**Step 1: Issue Analysis**
```markdown
# Issue Analysis Template

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Issue Category:** [functional/performance/compatibility]
- **Impact Scope:** [workflows affected]
- **User Impact:** [severity level]

## Technical Analysis
- **Code Changes Needed:** [list specific changes]
- **Testing Required:** [test scenarios]
- **Timeline Estimate:** [development + testing time]

## Recovery Options
1. **Hotfix Release:** Quick fix for critical issues
2. **Major Version:** Significant changes requiring v2.0.0
3. **Feature Toggle:** Gradual rollout with feature flags
```

**Step 2: Recovery Strategy Selection**

```bash
# Recovery decision matrix
case "$ISSUE_SEVERITY" in
    "critical")
        echo "Strategy: Hotfix release within 48 hours"
        RECOVERY_STRATEGY="hotfix"
        ;;
    "major")
        echo "Strategy: Major version release with migration period"
        RECOVERY_STRATEGY="major_version"
        ;;
    "enhancement")
        echo "Strategy: Feature development in next minor version"
        RECOVERY_STRATEGY="minor_version"
        ;;
esac
```

#### Implementation Approaches

**Approach A: Hotfix Release**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/hotfix-release.yml
name: Emergency Hotfix Release

on:
  push:
    branches: [hotfix/*]
    
jobs:
  hotfix-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build and Test Hotfix
        run: |
          bun install
          bun test
          bun run build
          
      - name: Create Hotfix Release
        run: |
          # Create patch release (e.g., v1.0.1)
          gh release create v1.0.1 \
            --title "Hotfix v1.0.1" \
            --notes "Emergency hotfix for critical issues"
```

**Approach B: Major Version Development**
```bash
# Long-term recovery with major version
git checkout -b v2-development

# Plan major version changes
echo "Planning v2.0.0 architecture..."
mkdir -p docs/v2-design
cat > docs/v2-design/architecture.md << EOF
# SST Operations Action v2.0.0 Architecture

## Rollback Testing Procedures ✅

### Pre-Production Testing

**Test Environment Setup:**
```bash
# Create rollback testing environment
git checkout -b rollback-testing
cp -r .github/workflows .github/workflows.backup

# Apply rollback changes
sed -i 's/kodehort\/sst-operations-action@v1/kodehort\/sst-operations-action@v1.0.0/g' \
    .github/workflows/*.yml
```

**Rollback Validation Tests:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# rollback-validation.sh

echo "🧪 Running rollback validation tests..."

# Test 1: Workflow syntax validation
echo "Test 1: YAML syntax validation"
for workflow in .github/workflows/*.yml; do
    yamllint "$workflow" && echo "✅ $workflow" || echo "❌ $workflow"
done

# Test 2: Action reference validation
echo "Test 2: Action reference validation" 
grep -r "kodehort/sst-operations-action" .github/workflows/ | while read line; do
    echo "Found: $line"
    # Validate version exists
    version=$(echo "$line" | grep -o "@v[0-9.]*")
    echo "Validating version: $version"
done

# Test 3: Functionality test (if possible)
echo "Test 3: Functionality validation"
