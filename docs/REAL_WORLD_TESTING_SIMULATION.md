      - uses: kodehort/sst-operations-action@v1
        with:
          operation: diff
          stage: staging
          comment-mode: always
          
  deploy-preview:
    needs: diff
    if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'deploy-preview')
    steps:
      - uses: kodehort/sst-operations-action@v1
        id: deploy
        with:
          operation: deploy
          stage: pr-${{ github.event.number }}
          comment-mode: on-success
          
      # Integration testing would go here
      # curl -f ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.urls[0] }}/health
          
  cleanup:
    if: github.event.action == 'closed'
    steps:
      - uses: kodehort/sst-operations-action@v1
        with:
          operation: remove
          stage: pr-${{ github.event.number }}
```
