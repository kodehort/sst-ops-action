- ü§ñ **Automatic Stage Inference** - Automatically compute stage names from Git context (branches, PRs)
- üìù **Automated PR Comments** - Rich markdown comments with deployment status and changes
- üîç **Infrastructure Diff** - See planned changes before deployment
- üßπ **Resource Cleanup** - Automated removal of staging environments
- üéØ **Stage Calculation** - Manual stage name computation from Git branches (when needed)
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable Runtime** - Support for Bun, npm, pnpm, Yarn, or direct SST CLI
- üìä **GitHub Integration** - Workflow summaries, artifacts, and status reporting

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Deploy (Automatic Stage)

```yaml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: kodehort/sst-ops-action@v1
        with:
          operation: deploy
          # Stage automatically computed from branch/PR name
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Basic Deploy (Explicit Stage)

```yaml
name: Deploy to Staging
on:
  push:
    branches: [develop]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: kodehort/sst-ops-action@v1
        with:
          operation: deploy
          stage: staging
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Infrastructure Diff on PRs

```yaml
name: Infrastructure Diff

  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  diff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: kodehort/sst-ops-action@v1
        with:
          operation: diff
          # Stage automatically computed from PR branch name
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          comment-mode: always
```

### Cleanup on PR Close

```yaml
name: Cleanup Resources
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]

jobs:
  cleanup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: kodehort/sst-ops-action@v1
        with:
          operation: remove
          stage: pr-${{ github.event.number }}
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Automatic Stage Inference

```yaml
name: Auto-Deploy
on:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      # Stage is automatically computed from Git context
      - name: Deploy
        uses: kodehort/sst-ops-action@v1
        with:
          operation: deploy

## üéØ Operation-Specific Examples

Each operation type has different input requirements and behavior patterns. Choose the right operation for your use case:

### üöÄ Deploy Operation
**Purpose**: Deploy infrastructure to AWS  
**Stage**: Optional - auto-computed from Git context if not provided  
**Token**: Required for infrastructure access and PR comments

```yaml
# Auto-compute stage from branch/PR name
- name: Deploy (Auto Stage)
  uses: kodehort/sst-ops-action@v1
  with:
    operation: deploy
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

# Explicit stage name
- name: Deploy to Production
  uses: kodehort/sst-ops-action@v1
  with:
    operation: deploy
    stage: production
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    comment-mode: always
    runner: npm
```

### üîç Diff Operation
**Purpose**: Preview infrastructure changes without deploying  
**Stage**: Required - need target stage to compare against  
**Token**: Required for PR comments

```yaml
# Compare against existing stage
- name: Preview Infrastructure Changes
  uses: kodehort/sst-ops-action@v1
  with:
    operation: diff
    stage: production  # Required - what to compare against
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    comment-mode: always

# Compare branch changes against main
- name: PR Infrastructure Diff
  uses: kodehort/sst-ops-action@v1
  with:
    operation: diff
    stage: ${{ github.base_ref || 'main' }}
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### üóëÔ∏è Remove Operation
**Purpose**: Delete deployed resources for cleanup  
**Stage**: Required - explicit stage name for safety  
**Token**: Required for authentication and confirmation

```yaml
# Clean up PR resources
- name: Remove PR Resources
  uses: kodehort/sst-ops-action@v1
  with:
    operation: remove
    stage: pr-${{ github.event.number }}  # Required for safety
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    comment-mode: on-success

  id: stage
  uses: kodehort/sst-ops-action@v1
  with:
    operation: stage

# Custom stage name parameters
- name: Compute Stage with Custom Rules
  id: stage
  uses: kodehort/sst-ops-action@v1
  with:
    operation: stage

### Remove Operation

Removes all resources for the specified stage.

```yaml
- uses: kodehort/sst-ops-action@v1
  with:
    operation: remove
    stage: pr-${{ github.event.number }}
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

- ‚úÖ Tracks cleanup status
- ‚úÖ Handles partial cleanup scenarios
- ‚úÖ Auto-confirms removal in CI

**Use Cases:**
- PR environment cleanup
- Staging environment reset
- Cost optimization
- Resource cleanup

### Stage Operation

Calculates SST stage name from Git branch or pull request information.

```yaml
- uses: kodehort/sst-ops-action@v1
  with:
    operation: stage
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

# With custom configuration
- uses: kodehort/sst-ops-action@v1
  with:
    operation: stage
    token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    truncation-length: 15
    prefix: fix-
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic stage name computation from Git references
- ‚úÖ Configurable truncation length (default: 26 characters)
- ‚úÖ Configurable prefix (default: `pr-`)
- ‚úÖ Branch name sanitization and normalization
- ‚úÖ Pull request and push event support
- ‚úÖ Fallback stage handling for edge cases
- ‚úÖ No SST CLI dependency required

**Use Cases:**
- Dynamic stage name generation
- Consistent branch-to-stage mapping
- Multi-environment workflows
- Pull request preview environments
- Branch-based deployments

**Automatic Stage Inference:**
- When `stage` input is not provided, the action automatically computes it from Git context
- Works with both push events (branch names) and pull request events (PR branch names)
- Uses the same computation rules as the manual stage operation
- Fallback to 'main' if no usable Git context is available

**Stage Computation Rules:**
- Removes path prefixes (`refs/heads/`, `feature/`)
- Converts to lowercase
- Replaces non-alphanumeric characters with hyphens
- Truncates to configurable length (default: 26 characters)
- Prefixes numeric branches with configurable prefix (default: `pr-`)
- Applies truncation including the prefix
- Removes leading/trailing hyphens after truncation

**Examples:**
| Branch | Event | Computed Stage | Auto/Manual | Notes |
|--------|-------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| `main` | push | `main` | Auto | Automatic inference |
| `feature/user-auth` | push | `user-auth` | Auto | Prefix removed |
| `feature/new-api` | pull_request | `new-api` | Auto | Same for PR events |
| `123-hotfix` | push | `pr-123-hotfix` | Auto | Default prefix `pr-` |
| `123-hotfix` | push | `fix-123-hotfix` | Manual | Custom prefix `fix-` |
| `refs/heads/develop` | push | `develop` | Auto | Git prefix stripped |
| `very-long-branch-name` | push | `very-long-branch-name-that` | Auto | Default truncation (26) |
| `very-long-branch-name` | push | `very-long-branc` | Manual | Custom truncation (15) |
| N/A | N/A | `production` | Manual | Explicit stage override |

    echo "Integration tests passed!"
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Token Permissions

This action requires minimal GitHub token permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read          # Read repository contents
  issues: write          # Create/update issue comments
  pull-requests: write   # Create/update PR comments
```

### AWS Credentials

Configure AWS credentials securely:

```yaml
env:
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
  AWS_REGION: us-east-1
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use environment-specific AWS accounts
- Enable CloudTrail for audit logging

### Secrets Management

```yaml
# Recommended secrets configuration
secrets:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # Automatic
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}

# Optional: Custom SST secrets
  SST_TELEMETRY_DISABLED: "1"
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "sst command not found"
**Solution:** Ensure SST CLI is installed in your project
```yaml
- name: Install SST CLI
  run: npm install @serverless-stack/cli
```

#### Issue: "Stage not found"
**Solution:** Verify stage exists in your SST configuration
```yaml
- name: Debug Stage
  run: |
    echo "Available stages:"
    npx sst list-stages || echo "No stages found"
```

#### Issue: AWS credentials not configured
**Solution:** Set up AWS credentials in repository secrets
```yaml
env:
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```
